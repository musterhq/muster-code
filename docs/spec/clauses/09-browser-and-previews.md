# MUS-SPEC-09: Browser and previews

A chat can open web pages and local app previews in a browser tab inside Muster, and the agent can use that browser.

What the user can do:
- open a URL or a local dev server in a browser tab, with back, forward, reload and dev tools;
- let the agent read, click and type in the page, and pick an element to point the agent at;
- keep sign-ins per workspace, and see the page picture-in-picture while working elsewhere.

Boundaries:
- Each workspace has its own browser storage; one workspace's sign-in does not leak to another.
- A page that hangs does not freeze the app.
