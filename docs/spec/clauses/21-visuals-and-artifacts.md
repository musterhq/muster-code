# MUS-SPEC-21: Visuals and artifacts

Replies can hold more than text: diagrams, charts, device frames, 3D models, canvases and artifacts the agent builds.

What the user can do:
- see diagrams and charts drawn from a reply, and code blocks with syntax colouring;
- open artifacts and canvases in a tab, and share or export them;
- see app previews inside device frames.

Boundaries:
- A visual that fails to render shows its source and a plain error, never a blank space.
- Device models and frames are downloaded at run time, never bundled.

## Acceptance cases

A PR that changes this area adds its cases here first: one row in this table, then the case block below it (see [acceptance-cases.md](../acceptance-cases.md)).

### Side chats

<a id="mus-spec-21-43a"></a>
#### MUS-SPEC-21-43A: Back to chat returns to the parent conversation

- Precondition: A side chat was opened from a main chat. Its tab fills the maximized right pane, so the main conversation is covered.
- Action: Click "Back to chat" in the side chat's header.
- Expected result: The main chat the side chat was opened from is the active conversation, the pane is restored so the conversation shows beside it, the conversation's message box has focus, and the side chat stays open with its messages.
- Test: `packages/agent-app/tests/side-chat-back-dom.tsx::Back to chat opens the parent conversation and keeps the side chat tab`
- Environment: DOM suite (linkedom) with a stubbed bridge; no provider or network.
- Known gaps: The pane's maximize state is held by a small stand-in with the same toggle contract as the real resource pane. The test does not show which chat is recorded as the parent when the side chat is created (the runtime stores `parentChatId`); it supplies it.
- Evidence: UNVERIFIED

<a id="mus-spec-21-43b"></a>
#### MUS-SPEC-21-43B: No Back to chat without a parent

- Precondition: A side chat that was created with no main chat open, and one whose parent chat has since been deleted.
- Action: Show each side chat's tab.
- Expected result: The header has no "Back to chat" control for either, and still has Open the resource, Promote and Discard.
- Test: `packages/agent-app/tests/side-chat-back-dom.tsx::No Back to chat control without a parent conversation`
- Environment: DOM suite (linkedom) with a stubbed bridge; no provider or network.
- Known gaps: None known.
- Evidence: UNVERIFIED

### Rich replies: diagrams, charts and reports

<a id="mus-spec-21-361a"></a>
#### MUS-SPEC-21-361A: Mermaid diagram renders

- Precondition: An assistant reply holds a mermaid fence (`flowchart LR`), first still open while streaming, then with its closing marker.
- Action: Show the reply while the fence is open, then once the closing fence arrives, then remount it.
- Expected result: While open the fence is an ordinary code block and the diagram renderer is not called. Once closed it becomes a ready "diagram" block titled "Flowchart" with the drawn SVG in its stage, the prose before it kept. Remounting the same source is served from the cache without rendering again.
- Test: `packages/agent-app/tests/rich-block-components.tsx::a closed mermaid fence in a reply draws as a diagram; while streaming it stays code`
- Environment: DOM suite (linkedom) with a stubbed bridge; the Mermaid renderer is a stub that returns an SVG.
- Known gaps: The real mermaid library is not loaded in this suite: the stub stands in for it, so layout and theming of the real SVG are not asserted.
- Evidence: UNVERIFIED

<a id="mus-spec-21-361b"></a>
#### MUS-SPEC-21-361B: Invalid Mermaid shows its source and the error

- Precondition: An assistant reply holds a closed mermaid fence whose source does not parse.
- Action: Show the reply, then click "Show source" on the error card.
- Expected result: The block is in its error state with "Couldn’t render this diagram" and the parse error text, never a blank block; "Show source" reveals the original source.
- Test: `packages/agent-app/tests/rich-block-components.tsx::an invalid mermaid fence shows the error card with the parse error and its source`
- Environment: DOM suite (linkedom) with a stubbed bridge; the Mermaid renderer is a stub that throws the parse error.
- Known gaps: The parse error comes from the stub, not from the real mermaid parser.
- Evidence: UNVERIFIED

<a id="mus-spec-21-361c"></a>
#### MUS-SPEC-21-361C: Vega chart renders

- Precondition: An assistant reply holds a closed chart fence: `{"type":"bar","title":"Users","data":[…],"x":"w","y":"u"}`.
- Action: Show the reply, switch to Table, back to Chart, then unmount the reply.
- Expected result: A ready "chart" block titled "Users" of kind "Bar chart" mounts one chart view, with the actions Show, Chart, Table, Copy source, Download, Open in tab, Full screen in that order. Table shows the columns w and u and two rows and disposes the chart view; Chart draws it again; unmounting disposes it.
- Test: `packages/agent-app/tests/rich-block-components.tsx::a chart fence draws a Vega chart with its title, a table view and disposal on unmount`
- Environment: DOM suite (linkedom) with a stubbed bridge; the Vega mount is a stub that records mounts and disposals.
- Known gaps: The real vega and vega-lite libraries are not loaded in this suite; the spec expansion to Vega-Lite is covered separately by tests/rich-block.test.ts.
- Evidence: UNVERIFIED

<a id="mus-spec-21-361d"></a>
#### MUS-SPEC-21-361D: HTML report runs without same-origin access

- Precondition: A report HTML document is shown through the shared sandboxed frame, once with scripts allowed and once without.
- Action: Render the frame each way.
- Expected result: With scripts the iframe sandbox is exactly "allow-scripts", referrer policy "no-referrer", allow "", and its src is a `muster-report://<32 hex>/index.html?v=1` URL registered through `reports.open`. Without scripts the sandbox attribute is empty.
- Test: `packages/agent-app/tests/rich-block-components.tsx::a report frame is scripts-only: no same-origin, served from its own muster-report origin`
- Environment: DOM suite (linkedom) with a stubbed bridge that answers `reports.open`.
- Known gaps: linkedom does not enforce the sandbox; tests/run-html-sandbox-security.mjs checks enforcement in headless Chrome when Chrome is present.
- Evidence: UNVERIFIED

<a id="mus-spec-21-361e"></a>
#### MUS-SPEC-21-361E: HTML report content security policy

- Precondition: The report origin builds its content security policy for a report.
- Action: Build the policy for a report with scripts and for one without.
- Expected result: With scripts the policy sets default, connect, frame, child, worker, object, form-action, base-uri and manifest sources to 'none', images to data: and blob: only, fonts to data: only and scripts to inline only; it holds no http(s) source, wildcard, eval or own-origin source. A page that must not run gets `script-src 'none'`.
- Test: `packages/agent-app/tests/report-origin.test.ts::the CSP allows no network at all and no way out of the sandbox`
- Environment: Node test of the report registry; no Electron window.
- Known gaps: Header delivery through the real `muster-report://` protocol handler is covered by the wiring test in the same file, not by this one.
- Evidence: UNVERIFIED

### Agent pages and previews

<a id="mus-spec-21-578a"></a>
#### MUS-SPEC-21-578A: render_html shows an agent page inline with the theme

- Precondition: An agent called render_html; the tool row holds the stored page id "Revenue dashboard", which asked for network.
- Action: Show the card, scroll it near the viewport, allow network for the page, open full screen and zoom in.
- Expected result: No frame mounts until the card nears the viewport; then the "Revenue dashboard" Page block opens the page through `htmlRenders.open`, with sandbox "allow-scripts" and a `muster-report://` src carrying the `#muster-theme=` fragment. The network note says https only; allowing it calls `htmlRenders.allowNetwork` and reloads the page. The actions are Copy source, Download, Open in tab, Full screen; full screen has zoom (125% after one Zoom in).
- Test: `packages/agent-app/tests/html-preview-components.tsx::a render_html page draws inline in the chat: themed, scripts-only sandbox, mounted near the viewport, full screen with zoom`
- Environment: DOM suite (linkedom) with a stubbed bridge and a fake IntersectionObserver.
- Known gaps: Live theme switches reaching an open page are asserted by the agent-page frame block of the same suite, not by this check.
- Evidence: UNVERIFIED

<a id="mus-spec-21-578b"></a>
#### MUS-SPEC-21-578B: preview_open shows a running dev server

- Precondition: A chat whose agent calls preview_open with a URL, against a fake browser host; once for a reachable server and once for one that refuses the connection.
- Action: Call preview_open with `0.0.0.0:5173`, then with panel: true, then with refused URL schemes (file:, javascript:, muster-report:, ftp:, empty), then against the stopped server on port 3000.
- Expected result: The agent tab opens localhost port 5173, the renderer gets a previewShown event for the chat's agent tab with panel false, and the answer mentions the mini player; panel: true sends panel true. Every refused scheme is an error. Against the stopped server the answer is an error naming "Connection refused (-102)" and the dev server, and the person still sees the preview with its unreachable page.
- Test: `packages/agent-app/tests/html-preview.test.ts::preview_open(url) opens the agent tab, shows the mini player (or the pane) and reports an unreachable server`
- Environment: Node test of the browser bridge with a fake browser host; no Electron window or real server.
- Known gaps: The mini player's streamed frames are not asserted here.
- Evidence: UNVERIFIED

### 3D models

<a id="mus-spec-21-366a"></a>
#### MUS-SPEC-21-366A: 3D model preview

- Precondition: A workspace folder holds models/cube.glb (a 24-vertex, 12-triangle cube).
- Action: Open it in a tab, open Model info, turn on Wireframe, choose Front, enter and leave full screen, then close it.
- Expected result: The block goes loading then ready, labelled "3D model · GLB: cube.glb", with a keyboard-reachable canvas and a toolbar holding Reset view, Wireframe, Save image of this view, Model info and the Front, 3/4 view, Top, Right views. Info shows 24 vertices, 12 triangles, size 1.00 × 1.00 × 1.00 and GLB · 2 KiB; Wireframe toggles; a view choice renders a frame; full screen enters and exits; the file is read in one chunk. Closing disposes the engine, releases the GL context and terminates the parse worker.
- Test: `packages/agent-app/tests/model-viewer-dom.tsx::a GLB model opens as an interactive 3D preview: canvas, views, info, wireframe, full screen, released on close`
- Environment: DOM suite (linkedom) built by tests/run-model-viewer-dom.mjs, with a fake WebGL renderer and a stubbed `files.modelChunk` bridge.
- Known gaps: No real GPU draws the model; pixels are not compared.
- Evidence: UNVERIFIED
