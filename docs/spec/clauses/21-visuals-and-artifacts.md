# MUS-SPEC-21: Visuals and artifacts

Replies can hold more than text: diagrams, charts, device frames, 3D models, canvases and artifacts the agent builds.

What the user can do:
- see diagrams and charts drawn from a reply, and code blocks with syntax colouring;
- open artifacts and canvases in a tab, and share or export them;
- see app previews inside device frames.

Boundaries:
- A visual that fails to render shows its source and a plain error, never a blank space.
- Device models and frames are downloaded at run time, never bundled.

## Acceptance cases

A PR that changes this area adds its cases here first: one row in this table, then the case block below it (see [acceptance-cases.md](../acceptance-cases.md)).
