# MUS-SPEC-10: Terminal and background processes

The terminal dock gives the user shells in the chat's folder. Background processes are commands and services the agent or the user leaves running.

What the user can do:
- open, split, rename and close terminals, and let the agent read or use a terminal when allowed;
- see running processes and listening ports, read their output, and stop or restart them;
- find a process's output again after a restart.

Boundaries:
- Quitting Muster stops the processes it started, unless the user chose to keep one.
- Output is kept within a size limit; older output is dropped with a marker, never silently.
