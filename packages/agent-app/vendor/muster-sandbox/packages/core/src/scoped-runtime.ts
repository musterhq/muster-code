/**
 * Scoped runtime v1 — the durable, scope-owned "computer" that belongs beside
 * Muster's scoped memory.
 *
 * Muster has resolved WHAT an agent may remember per scope since `memory.ts`
 * landed: 8 scope kinds (`types.ts` MemoryScopeKind), visibility enforced by
 * `isVisibleInScopes`. It has never resolved WHERE that agent's work lives,
 * WHICH environment variables reach it, or WHICH tools it may call. Every run
 * has shared one ambient process cwd and one ambient `process.env`. Sibling
 * systems (QM) pair each person/room scope with a durable computer — files,
 * env, permissions — so a scope's work survives restarts and cannot bleed into
 * a neighbour's. This module is that missing sibling: scope in, durable runtime
 * descriptor out.
 *
 * ═══ THIS IS A SEAM, NOT A SANDBOX ═══
 *
 * v1 resolves a scope set to a DESCRIPTOR — a deterministic directory, an env
 * allowlist, a deny-by-default tool policy, declared limits — and persists a
 * manifest so the binding survives restarts and can be audited. It never
 * spawns, wraps, or confines anything.
 *
 * EXPLICITLY OUT OF SCOPE for v1; do NOT read these guarantees into it:
 * container/jail/VM execution, seccomp/landlock/AppArmor confinement, real
 * cgroup or filesystem-quota enforcement, and network filtering. `limits`,
 * `envAllowlist`, and `toolPolicy` are DECLARATIONS that an executor must
 * enforce at spawn time; nothing in this file enforces them. A caller that
 * spawns a child with full ambient `process.env` after reading a descriptor
 * gets exactly zero protection from this module. `resolveRuntimeEnv` and
 * `effectiveToolAuthority` exist so that enforcement is one honest call away —
 * use them, or the policy is decorative.
 *
 * ═══ FOUR INVARIANTS ═══
 *
 * 1. DETERMINISTIC PATHS. The same scope set always resolves to the same
 *    absolute `workDir`, in this process and in one started a month later. No
 *    randomness, no timestamps, no counters in the path. That is what makes the
 *    directory DURABLE rather than a scratch dir with extra steps.
 *
 * 2. ONE OWNER, EXPLICIT PRECEDENCE. A scope set is a chain, most specific
 *    first; the most specific scope OWNS the directory, and every policy field
 *    is resolved independently by "most specific declaration wins"
 *    (`SCOPE_SPECIFICITY_ORDER`). Duplicate kinds in one set are rejected — an
 *    authority boundary with two candidate owners fails closed instead of
 *    picking one.
 *
 * 3. CONTAINMENT. A scope id is untrusted input. `scopedRuntimeSlug` reduces it
 *    to `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` and appends a sha256 prefix of the RAW id, so
 *    `"../../etc"` cannot escape the runtimes root and two distinct ids can
 *    never collide onto one directory after sanitising. A containment assertion
 *    backs the slug up rather than trusting it.
 *
 * 4. FAIL CLOSED ON REUSE. `ensureRuntime` verifies the on-disk manifest names
 *    the same scope chain before touching the directory. A mismatch throws and
 *    mutates nothing — same spirit as memory's `isVisibleInScopes`: authority is
 *    proven, never assumed. Corrupt manifests are an error, not a silent
 *    re-init (a silent re-init is indistinguishable from data loss).
 *
 * `auditRuntime` is the deliberate exception to invariant 4: it REPORTS damage
 * instead of throwing, because you cannot inspect a broken runtime with a
 * function that refuses to look at broken runtimes.

 *  • `workDir` is owned by the single most specific scope present. Ancestry
 *    changes policy, never the path — so a durable directory keeps its identity

 *  • `envAllowlist`, `toolPolicy`, `limits.maxProcesses`, `limits.maxDiskMb`,
