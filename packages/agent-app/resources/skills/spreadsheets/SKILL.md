description: Create, edit and review Excel workbooks (.xlsx) with Muster. Use whenever the person asks for a spreadsheet, budget, model, tracker, table of data as .xlsx, or to change an existing workbook. Writes live formulas with exceljs, keeps existing formatting when editing, renders the sheets to page images with office_render and fixes them until they read well.

# Spreadsheets (.xlsx)

Use this skill for any Excel workbook: new ones, edits to an existing .xlsx, and reviews. For a quick table in the
reply, or a .csv the person asked for, you do not need a workbook.

## Tools

- `muster_office` `office_setup`: call it once per chat before the first script. It answers with the command that
  runs a script (`<node> script.mjs`); with it `import ExcelJS from 'exceljs'` works from any folder. Do not
  `npm install` anything into the person's project.
- `muster_office` `office_render`: renders the workbook to page images (each sheet as it would print) and shows you
  the first pages. The first render may download LibreOffice; wait for it.
- Library: `exceljs` reads and writes .xlsx, including styles, number formats, formulas, merged cells, data
  validation, conditional formatting and pictures.

`example.mjs` next to this file is a tested starting point (two sheets, formulas across sheets, number formats, a
frozen header, a total row, a picture, print setup). Copy it into the working folder and change it.

## The loop

1. Plan the sheets: inputs, calculations, summary. Decide which cells are inputs and which are formulas.
2. Write a script in the working folder that builds the workbook. Keep the data at the top of the script.
3. Run it with the command from `office_setup`.
4. Call `office_render` and look at every page: headers, widths, number formats, totals.
5. Read the workbook back with exceljs and check that every formula cell still has its formula (see below).
6. Fix, run and render again until the checks pass. Reply with the path and what each sheet holds.

## Formulas stay formulas

- Write calculations as formulas, never as numbers you computed in the script: `{ formula: 'SUM(B2:B13)' }` (no
  leading `=`). Totals, ratios, lookups and cross-sheet references (`Sales!D5`) are all formulas.
- Set `workbook.calcProperties = { fullCalcOnLoad: true }` so Excel and LibreOffice recalculate everything when the
  file opens. Add `result` to a formula cell only when you know the exact value.
- Use only functions Excel has. Absolute references (`$D$14`) for fixed cells; check ranges cover every data row.
- Check after writing:

```js
const check = new ExcelJS.Workbook();
await check.xlsx.readFile('out.xlsx');
check.eachSheet(sheet => sheet.eachRow(row => row.eachCell(cell => {
  if (cell.formula || cell.sharedFormula) console.log(sheet.name, cell.address, '=', cell.formula ?? cell.sharedFormula);
})));
```

- The render shows the recalculated values: `#REF!`, `#NAME?`, `#DIV/0!` or `#VALUE!` on a page image is a bug to fix.

## Quality checks (on the page images)

- Column widths fit their content (no `####`, no cut-off headers); long text wraps (`alignment: { wrapText: true }`).
- Numbers use the right format: money `"$"#,##0.00`, counts `#,##0`, percents `0.0%`, dates `yyyy-mm-dd` or the
  person's locale. Numbers are stored as numbers, not text.
- The header row stands out and is frozen (`views: [{ state: 'frozen', ySplit: 1 }]`); totals are visibly separate.
- Each sheet prints to a sensible width: `pageSetup: { orientation, fitToPage: true, fitToWidth: 1, fitToHeight: 0 }`.
- Sheet names are short and say what they hold.

## Charts

exceljs cannot write native Excel charts. Tell the person, then either put a chart picture on the sheet
(`workbook.addImage` and `sheet.addImage`) or, if they want an editable chart, make it in a presentation with the
presentations skill. Never leave a sheet with a promised chart missing.

## Editing an existing workbook

Load it with exceljs, change only the cells you need, and save to a new file unless the person asked to overwrite
theirs. exceljs keeps cell styles, number formats, merged cells, column widths and formulas it read. It does not keep
charts, pivot tables, slicers or macros: if the workbook has any (look for `xl/charts/`, `xl/pivotTables/` or
`vbaProject.bin` inside the file with `jszip`), say so and ask before saving over it, or change cell values directly in
the sheet XML with `jszip`.

```js
const workbook = new ExcelJS.Workbook();
await workbook.xlsx.readFile('budget.xlsx');
const sheet = workbook.getWorksheet('Budget');
sheet.getCell('C7').value = 4200;                     // an input
sheet.getCell('C20').value = { formula: 'SUM(C2:C19)' };
workbook.calcProperties = { fullCalcOnLoad: true };
await workbook.xlsx.writeFile('budget-updated.xlsx');
```

Render the original and the new file and compare them before you reply.

## Reading a workbook

Load it with exceljs and print the used range of each sheet (`sheet.actualRowCount`, `row.values`); for a formula
cell, `cell.formula` is the formula and `cell.result` the value saved with it. Render it to see how it looks.
